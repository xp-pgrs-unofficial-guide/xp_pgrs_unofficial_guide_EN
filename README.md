# Unofficial Guide for XJTLU PhD Students
The purpose of this guide is to make up for the many shortcomings of the official induction and to provide experience for future PhD students based on the idea of "planting trees for future generations to enjoy the shade."

This project is initiated by the XJTLU PRG Society and now managed by voluntary editors. Feel free to check it out and download it ([Download Link](https://github.com/xp-pgrs-unofficial-guide/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide_EN/releases/latest)).

If this project has helped you, please give it a star in the upper right corner.

## Contribution Methods
If you have gained some experience during your PhD, such as solving encountered problems or discovering resources that might help other students, you are welcome to write a guide to help your juniors. The methods are:
- Directly send the original draft (txt, tex, word are all acceptable) to the project administrator via email (shiyao.zhang14@student), or directly paste the original draft or upload the file on the discussion or issue page, and the project administrator will organize it.
- Submit a PR. Create your own folder under the author-folder, create a new tex file in it, start writing with the section command on the first line, then find the chapter your guide belongs to in the chapters directory and insert it using the input command.


For more detailed writing guidelines, please refer to the "Writing Guide" chapter in the PDF ([Download Link](https://github.com/xp-pgrs-unofficial-guide/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide_EN/releases/latest)).
