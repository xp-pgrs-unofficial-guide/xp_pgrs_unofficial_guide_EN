\section{Compulsory Courses}
The university offers a series of courses for doctoral students, which are announced on the Learning Mall page (\href{https://core.xjtlu.edu.cn/course/view.php?id=847}{link here}), and also notified via emails titled \textit{Updates on Workshops for Postgraduate Research Students}. Most of these courses can be attended based on your own level, but there are two that you must attend; otherwise, you cannot graduate. They are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervisor-Supervisee Relationships
    \item Research Integrity (Ethics)
\end{itemize}

These two workshops are held every \textbf{semester}, but you must attend each of them at least once before graduation, based on the sign-in via QR code at the time of attendance.
