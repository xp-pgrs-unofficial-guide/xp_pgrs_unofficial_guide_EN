\section{Free Printing}

Every September, the school resets the printing balance for PhD students to 2000 yuan (you can check it at \url{https://myprint.xjtlu.edu.cn}), which means that each PhD student almost has unlimited printing funds. Personally, I like to print out all the papers to read.
For instructions on how to print, I suggest referring to the official documentation. The files are available in this projectâ€™s GitHub repository (link below) or at the following links:
Undergraduate IT Guide (in Chinese and English): \url{https://gitee.com/kaiwu-astro/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide/tree/main/fileshare}
Printing Guide (in English): \url{https://guide.xjtlu.edu.cn/ss-print/staff}
Please note, do not use this for printing entire books as it violates the printing policy and may be detected. However, printing individual chapters of books is generally allowed. If you must print an entire book, please use Taobao.
