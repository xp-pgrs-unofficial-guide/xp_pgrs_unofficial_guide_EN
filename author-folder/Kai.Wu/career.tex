\section{Important Information Related to Employment}

Regarding student status, academic qualifications, employment materials, etc., it is recommended to first read the FAQ at the school's career center: \url{https://careers.xjtlu.edu.cn/Dispatch/Home/Master}

\subsection{Student Status and Xuexin Website?}

During our study period, student status cannot be found on the Xuexin Website, but it can be checked on the Ministry of Education's Sino-foreign Joint Program Supervision website: \url{http://rzzccx.crs.jsj.edu.cn/}. Therefore, don't think about student discounts like Haidilao's university student discount that requires Xuexin Website verificationâ€”you won't be able to enjoy them. There is a chance to enjoy benefits at the Apple Store; policies vary each year, so it is recommended to call the Apple Store directly to inquire.

After graduation, your Liverpool degree must be authenticated by the Chinese Ministry of Education to be recognized by the Chinese government. See Section \ref{sec.thesis_viva_graduation}

\subsection{Transcripts?}

Unlike domestic doctoral programs, we do not have transcripts upon graduation. Transcripts correspond to the "HEAR report" at Liverpool, but some students have asked Liverpool officials and were clearly told that PhD students do not have HEAR reports. If your employer rigidly requires a transcript, you can email Liverpool to inquire.
