\section{XJTLU Virtual Machine}
\url{https://vdi.xjtlu.edu.cn/portal/webclient/index.html}
If you are outside the university and want to quickly access on-campus resources and software temporarily, you can use the university's online virtual machine. The virtual machine is equivalent to a computer located on campus.

\section{Library Literature Databases}
After connecting to the campus network, most of the journals subscribed by the university can be directly downloaded from the journal pages. However, (1) some journal websites cannot recognize your IP, such as the famous Annual Review series; (2) if you want to download papers off-campus, you can use the library's literature databases.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

What I use most is clicking e-journal on the homepage \url{https://lib.xjtlu.edu.cn}, searching for the journal by name, and then accessing it through a dedicated link. The library also provides many full-text databases, including CNKI and other Chinese journal databases. For detailed usage, see the library's past training sessions \url{https://core.xjtlu.edu.cn/course/view.php?id=905}, or directly find the PPT in this project's GitHub (\href{https://github.com/xp-pgrs-unofficial-guide/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide/tree/main/fileshare}{link}).

\section{Borrowing Books from Suzhou Library and Free Book Delivery}
If you want to read books from Dushu Lake Library or borrow books from Suzhou Library but don't want to go there because it's too far, what should you do? Just use the mini program to borrow books! Books from Suzhou Library can be \textbf{[free of charge]} delivered to Dushu Lake Library for pickup, and books from Dushu Lake Library can be directly delivered to the entrance of the university library.

Search for the mini program "Suzhou Library Borrow Books" on WeChat. Since the medical insurance card is the citizen card, you can use it to borrow books directly. If you have already obtained the medical insurance card, you can bind it directly to waive the card opening fee. Then follow the prompts in the mini program.

\section{Pay Attention to Your Negative Emotions and Depression Tendencies}
\label{sec.mental_health}

The \href{http://ga.berkeley.edu/wellbeingreport}{Graduate Student Happiness and Well-Being Report [link]} published by the Berkeley Graduate Assembly in 2014 shows that 46\% of Ph.D. students have mental health problems. Studies published in authoritative journals such as Nature suggest:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Graduate students are six times more likely to suffer from severe anxiety and depression than the general population \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089}{[reference link]}
    \item Smarter people are more likely to suffer from mood disorders such as anxiety or depression but are less likely to seek help \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7677-549a}{[reference link]}
    \item Mood disorders account for 80-90\% of suicides \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616303324}{[reference link]}
    \item During the COVID-19 pandemic, four out of five researchers showed signs of mental health distress \href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21568235.2021.1992293}{[reference link]}
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

As a high-risk group, we have received extensive professional knowledge and skills training, yet almost no one has taught us "how to maintain mental health." If you often feel nervous, anxious, or disappointed now, and even have symptoms like insomnia, please immediately face your situation, put your health first, and feel free to seek help from the university's psychological counseling center.

Meanwhile, prevention is always more effective than post-treatment. I hope that everyone reading this, whether you feel good now or not, will click the links below, read Zoe Ayres' lecture in Liverpool (the source of the above PPTs), and her book "\textit{Managing Your Mental Health During Your PhD - A Survival Guide}," to get through your graduate studies healthily. ~~\href{https://github.com/xp-pgrs-unofficial-guide/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide/tree/main/fileshare}{[GitHub link]}~~~~~\href{https://gitee.com/kaiwu-astro/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide/tree/main/fileshare}{[Use this link if you can't access GitHub]}

\section{What Software Have You Installed on Your Computer? (Looking Forward to Your Additions)}

\KW: Let me start by sharing some software that I would definitely recommend to my fellow junior students:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{author-folder/Kai.Wu/kai_mac_dock.jpg}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research and Productivity Tools
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Notion (All platforms). An incredibly powerful new-generation note-taking app. I was originally a heavy OneNote user, but after being introduced to Notion by chance, I decided to abandon OneNote and completely switch to Notion after a short trial. Recommended because: supports Win/Mac/Linux/Web/iOS/Android; powerful database functions to perfectly build your own GTD system and greatly improve efficiency; fast global search; modern collaboration features, even usable for team and project management; powerful sharing features to easily share notes as public webpages; lots of tutorials on Bilibili.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{author-folder/Kai.Wu/notion.jpg}
        \item TickTick (All platforms). I've used Wunderlist (later acquired by Microsoft and became Microsoft To-Do), iOS's built-in Reminders, and several other list apps for a long time. Only TickTick feels the most intuitive and user-friendly. Used together with Notion, it can conveniently manage all aspects of study and life. Supports all platforms.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{author-folder/Kai.Wu/dida.jpg}
        \item Trello (All platforms). Manage your to-do items and tasks with cards. My supervisor heavily relies on Trello to keep his numerous tasks well-organized. While I think Notion is a superset of Trello, if you don't like Notion for some reason, at least try Trello. Available for download on all platforms.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{author-folder/Kai.Wu/trello.jpg}
        \item VSCode (Visual Studio Code) (All PC platforms). An open-source text editor that rose to prominence around 2019, with extremely strong community and plugin support. Currently, I use VSCode + LaTeX Workshop plugin for my journal papers, theses, and even this guide you're reading. All my numerical simulation programs and data analysis scripts are also done with VSCode. The drawbacks are a small learning curve and the need to configure settings; it also consumes memory like Chrome.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{author-folder/Kai.Wu/vscode.jpg}
        \item Spark. An email app developed by Readdle, an award-winning Apple app developer, that manages all your email accounts in one place and syncs email settings to the cloud, solving the problem of re-adding multiple email accounts when you get a new device. It seems to be exclusive to Mac and iOS; not sure if it's available on other platforms.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{author-folder/Kai.Wu/spark.jpg}
        \item As for reference management software, I won't make recommendations—everyone has their own preferences. If you don't have one yet, ask your seniors or check out recommendations on Bilibili.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Efficiency Tools
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Bob (MacOS) or Pot (Win/Mac/Linux). Tools for word translation, screenshot translation, and OCR. Supports integration with ChatGPT, DeepL, Google Translate, Youdao Translate, and other translation services, and can even display results from multiple platforms simultaneously for comparison. Bob can be downloaded from the Mac App Store; Pot is available at pot-app.com.

    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Have you discovered any great software? Please feel free to share them with your fellow junior students.
